webp.js
======

<h3>Implement now WebP images on your site</h3>
<p>The library load a webp image if the browser is supported, else load a jpg, png or whatever format you want in img tag</p>

<h4>How can i serve different images for different browsers?</h4>
<p>In order to load the correct image you need to upload the same image with the same name and different extension of course, .webp and .jpg|.png|.gif</p>

<h4>How can i convert a png, jpg image to WebP format?</h4>
<p>Well you can go to Google Developers Site and search for "WebP" (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/). The page shows you how convert image from or to WebP format.</p>

<h4>How implement the webp.js library?</h4>
<p>It's very easy to configure webp.js library, just need load the ".min" file in the head section of your html. Example:</p>
```HTML
<html>
<head>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../lib/webp.min.js"></script>
</head>
</html>
```

<h4>And now, how load the image files?</h4>
<p>For achieve the goal of load the correct image and execute one only request to server, we need use the data-* property for img tag, in this case we use data-src & data-format. In the data-src attribute you can specify the filename and path for that file (without extension). On other hand in the data-format attribute you may specify the format (extension) which is loaded in which case of the web browser not supported WebP. Example:</p>
```html
<body>
	<img data-src="./test" data-format="png" alt="WebP Image"/>
</body>
```
<p>If the browser supports webp the result of img tag will look something like this...</p>
```html
<img data-src="./test" data-format="png" alt="WebP Image" src="./test.webp"/>
```
<p>If the browser NOT supports webp will look like this...</p>
```html
<img data-src="./test" data-format="png" alt="WebP Image" src="./test.png"/>
```

<h4>And, if the user has disabled javascript?</h4>
<p>Obviously if the user has disabled javascript from his browser, the library not work at all. Solution:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Asks the user to enable the javascript duh!</li>
	<li>Put the same image with png, jpg extension after the webp image, inside of noscript html tag. Example:</li>
</ol>
```HTML
<noscript>
	<img src="./test.png" alt="WebP Image"/>
</noscript>
```
<br/>
<p>At last but not least important, I would like you to contribute with the project if you think is awesome or maybe a little functional, and thanks for the feedback!</p>
